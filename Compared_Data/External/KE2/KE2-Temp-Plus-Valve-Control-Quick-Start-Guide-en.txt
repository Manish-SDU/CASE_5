The Temp + Valve includes RS-485 Modbus communications, and can now
be accessed remotely using the KE2 Edge Manager (KE2-EM). See page 4 for
additional details.
Service Call Saver - Post Defrost Indicator
To eliminate unnecessary service calls, the KE2 Temp + Valve alerts the user
when it is coming out of a defrost cycle using the onboard display. The display
alternates between dEF and the actual temperature measured by the air sensor.
This continues until the temperature has reached setpoint, or for the amount of
time set by dFt (Defrost Time) whichever is shorter.

Wiring the Controller
A
The Temp + Valve was designed with functionality in mind. The con-
troller accepts 120V / 208-240V to power the controller through the
lower conduit connection. The temperature sensor, pressure trans-
ducer, valve, and communication wires are attached via the upper
conduit connector.
A When wiring the controller first remove the display by loosening
the four corner screws. The display is connected to the lower board
by a short ribbon cable.
Caution: The board may be damaged if excessive force is used
when removing the cover.
B
B After the four screws have been detached from the lower section,
the cover may be gently moved to the side. C
C Next remove the high voltage protective cover. There are two screws
holding it in place.
D With the high voltage cover removed, the two screw terminal con- D
nectors can be seen. The Red 2-position connector is the controller’s
power supply. E
E Connect line (L1) ① to the right most terminal position and neutral
(L2) ② to the terminal position.
F The liquid line solenoid-compressor contactor relay accepts a vari-
F
ety of input voltages and is not required to match the controller’s
input. See table for relay ratings. The relay uses the 3-position screw
terminal to make the connection on the board. It may control either
the liquid line solenoid or as a pilot to the compressor contactor.
When connecting the wires to the relay, the controller will be break-
ing one leg of the power.
If solenoid will use the same voltage as controller, one leg of incom-
ing power (L1) ⑤ supply for the liquid line solenoid should be con-
nected to the common terminal of the liquid line solenoid relay, the
left most terminal connection. The other leg of the incoming power
(L2) should be connected directly to the solenoid lead. The remain-
Relay Rating
ing lead from the solenoid should be connected to the NO (normally
open) ③ terminal, the center terminal location.

Low Voltage Connections
H Air Temperature Sensor - The air temperature sensor terminal is lo-
cated on the cover’s circuit board, and is permanently attached. The
temperature sensor input consists of the right two terminal positions.
The sensor is not polarized and may be connected in either orienta-
tion.
The sensor should be fed through the top conduit connection, before
being attached to the board.
This terminal is also used for an External System Off signal in certain
control modes. See the diagrams at the end of the bulletin for more
detailed information.
J I H
I Suction Temperature Sensor - The suction temperature sensor
terminal is located on the cover’s circuit board, and is permanently
attached. The temperature sensor input consists of the middle two
terminal positions. The sensor is not polarized and may be connected
in either orientation.
The suction temperature sensor is required when applying the con-
troller with an electronic expansion valve. The sensor’s proximity
to the evaporator outlet differs slightly for electronically controlled
valves from the placement of a TEV bulb. Due to the more refined
control from an electronically controlled valve, the sensor must be
placed as close to the outlet of the coil as feasible.
Although the distance from the outlet is different, the nature of the
refrigerant’s flow through the tube remains unchanged, thus the ori-
entation of the sensor remains at the 4 or 8 o’clock position. The sen-
sor should be secured to the suction line using the included wire ties
designed or low ambient operation. Only zip tie the sensor bulb,
DO NOT zip tie the sensor cable.
This terminal is also used for an External System Off signal in certain
control modes. See the diagrams at the end of the bulletin for more
detailed information.
J
Pressure Transducer – The pressure transducer terminal is located
on the cover’s circuit board, and is permanently attached. The pres-
sure transducer input consists of the 3 terminal positions on the left-
hand side of the board.
When replacing a mechanical expansion valve, the external equalizer
can be repurposed for the pressure transducer. Cut and braze a 1/4”
male SAE fitting with schrader valve to the external equalizer. The
pressure transducer can alternatively be attached to the suction ser-
vice port on the evaporator’s suction header. If a suction port is not
available, mount the pressure tap on the top of a horizontal section of
tube, approx. 3 inches downstream of the suction temperature sen-
sor.

The KE2 Temp + Valve includes RS-485 Modbus communications, and
