        "2. Functions": "• Temperature control\n• Air defrost control\n• Electronic expansion valve (EEV) control\n• Liquid line solenoid or compressor contactor pilot control\n• Remote monitoring, control, and alarm notifications (requires KE2-EM)",
        "3. Core features": "• Temperature regulation\n• Air defrost management\n• Electronic valve control",
        "4. Additional features": "• Post Defrost Indicator ('Service Call Saver'): Display alternates 'dEF' and actual temperature after a defrost cycle\n• External System Off signal capability using sensor terminals",
        "5. User experience": "• Onboard display for local status and temperature indication\n• Post-defrost cycle status is explicitly shown on the display\n• Remote access and control via Smartphone or Tablet when connected to the KE2 Edge Manager (KE2-EM)",
        "6. Connectivity": "• Communication Protocol: RS-485 Modbus\n• Required Wiring: 18 gauge twisted shielded pair for communication\n• Connects to KE2 Edge Manager (KE2-EM) for remote access and WiFi connectivity",
        "7. Standards compliance": "Information not available",
        "8. Notes": "• A suction temperature sensor is required for electronic expansion valve control\n• The relay's input voltage is not required to match the controller’s input voltage\n• Temperature sensors are not polarized"
